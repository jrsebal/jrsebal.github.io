Using structural biology approaches, we have identified that the stacking of precise residues at the most immunogenic region of the MUC1 antigen against aromatic side chains of the antibody is a fundamental feature of the antibody-antigen complex. In this project, **the strength of these interactions will be tuned by introducing fluorine atoms to specific positions of these residues.** The synthesis of several derivatives will provide the next generation of structure-based antigens, characterized by an improved affinity relative to the natural ones. These antigens will be utilized, by standard ELISA assays, to detect circulating anti-MUC1 antibodies in patient sera suffering from several types of cancer, such as prostate, breast  or ovarian cancer at different stages of the disease.
