Tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs), such as Tn antigen, are crucial components of cancer vaccines. Although vaccines based on native TACAs show immunogenicity and protection in preclinical animal studies, their weak immunogenicity, low stability and poor bioavailability have discouraged their further evaluations in clinical studies.
To overcome these issues, we postulate that TACA-based vaccines displaying **mimics instead of native Tn antigens** can be more resistant to enzymatic degradation, which might translate into increased in vivo bioavailability and stronger immune response. Moreover, we consider that **the mode of presentation of the Tn antigens is also a determinant factor.** In this regard, we have recently reported that engineered MUC1-based vaccines having unnatural amino acids have to be capable to emulate the conformational and dynamics properties of the glycosidic linkage GalNAc-threonine present in the natural Tn antigen.
Bearing these ideas in mind, we are now focus on developing **novel vaccines** based on the use of **unnatural antigens** presented on the surface of **nanoparticles** loaded with different immunostimulants.
